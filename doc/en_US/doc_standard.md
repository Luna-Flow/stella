# Documentation Standard

This repository's documentation must describe the real implementation on the current branch for Luna-Flow/stella. It should stay aligned with the exported surface, repository layout, and release narrative.

## Rules

- Provide `README.md`, `doc_standard.md`, and structured module or subsystem documents for every supported locale.
- Document only APIs, workflows, and design decisions that exist in the current branch.
- Keep the directory layout aligned with real package or subsystem boundaries.
- Each module or subsystem directory must contain `api.md`, `tutorial.md`, and `design.md`.
- Use cross-links between related mutable/immutable, runtime/frontend, or spec/implementation areas when semantics differ.
